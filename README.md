## data

The code uses data from the World Bank (Creative Commons by-4.0) and the US EIA (public
domain). A snapshot of the data is stored in a [separate repository](
https://github.com/decarbonizenews/energygraph-data). You can download and unpack the
data to the correct path by running:

```
./getdata.sh
```
